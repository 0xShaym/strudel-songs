## What is Strudel?

[Strudel](https://strudel.cc/) is a web-based live coding environment for making music. It allows you to create beats, melodies, and entire compositions by writing code in your browser. Inspired by TidalCycles, Strudel makes algorithmic music composition accessible to everyoneâ€”no installation required! You can experiment with patterns, samples, and synthesizers using JavaScript-like syntax, making it perfect for both beginners and experienced live coders.
